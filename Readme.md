# Per-Minecart Max Speed Customiser Minecraft Mod

This mod allows you to set the **maximum speed for each minecart entity individually**, rather than relying on the global minecart speed limit set by Minecraft's gamerules. Using a wrench item provided by the mod, you can fine-tune the speed of every minecart in your world, giving you precise control over minecart-based transportation systems.

## Features

- Assign custom max speeds per individual minecart
- Easy-to-use wrench tool for adjusting speed values in-game
- Does not affect minecarts globally settings are entity-specific
